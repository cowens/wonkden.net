			Hi, I am Chas.  It is odd to be talking about myself, so I will try to hit the 
			high points.
			<p>Let's start with my name.  It is Charles Joseph Owens IV, but I usually use the 
			offical abbreviation, not nickname, Chas. as my name.  The period is optional, but 
			I tend to use it.  My name is pronounced Chaz.  I am called Chas. because there was
			already a Charles, Charlie, and a Chuck.  If I ever have a son, his name will be
			Charles Joseph Owens V, and we will call him Quin (quintus is five in Latin).
			</p>
			<p>
			I am a geek.  Specificaly I am a Unix/programming geek.  I work mostly with Perl
			these days and I am looking forward to Perl 6, whenever it arrives.  I tend to
			run Linux (Ubuntu is my current distribution of choice) as my operating system,
			but lately I have been dabbling with Mac OS X.
			</p>
