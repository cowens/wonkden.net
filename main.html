				Just a day too late for April Fool's day, I have finally written a module
				that can be shared with others: the <a href="modules.html">warnin's pragma</a>.
				It is like the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/warnings.html">warnings pragma</a>
				but with more casual language.  I have applied for a PAUSE ID and hope to be
				uploading it to <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a> soon.

				Well, those articles never did get written, but I do have another set planned.
				Amazingly enough, the first of them is currently being written.  They are going
				to cover the Core Perl functions and modules.  I am writing them for a new
				website a friend is starting.  The first article will cover <code>chop</code>, 
				<code>chomp</code>, <code>tr///</code>, and <code>y///</code>.  Kudos go to 
				whomever can puzzle out what those four functions have in common.

				I have also made this site XHTML 1.0 Strict compliant.  It did not take much
				work.  For the most part it already was compliant, I had a few h3 tags inside 
				of a tags, some list item weirdness, a few link tags that did not have a 
				terminator, the html tag did not set its namespace, and the charset was set to 
				ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8 (that last one was a configuration mismatch between
				my web server and the pages themselves).  The biggest problem wasn't with my 
				HTML; it was with the video player I use on the "About me" page.

				Welcome to WonkDen.  In the near future I plan on adding some articles about
				the art of programming and what it means to be a programmer.  For now, I just
				have my bio, r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and an explaination of the code that acts
				as a front page.
